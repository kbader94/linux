	tristate "LIN bus subsystem support"
	help
	  Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial
	  communications protocol. Development of the CAN bus started in
	  1983 at Robert Bosch GmbH, and the protocol was officially
	  released in 1986. The CAN bus was originally mainly for automotive,
	  but is now widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical
	  applications. More information on the CAN network protocol family
	  PF_CAN is contained in <Documentation/networking/can.rst>.

	  If you want CAN support you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your controller(s) under the Network device
	  support section.

config LIN_RAW
	tristate "Raw LIN Protocol (raw access with LIN-ID filtering)"
	default y
	help
	  The raw LIN protocol option offers access to the LIN bus via
	  the BSD socket API. You probably want to use the raw socket in
	  most cases where no higher level protocol is being used. The raw
	  socket has several filter options e.g. ID masking / error frames.
	  To receive/send raw LIN messages, use AF_LIN with protocol LIN_RAW.

config LIN_FRAME_SCHED
	tristate "Frame Slot Scheduling"
	default y
	help
	  Frame slot scheduling allows for the cyclical dispatch of LIN messages without permanent user
	  interaction. The schedule can be 'programmed' via the BSD socket API and
	  informs you on demand e.g. only on content updates / timeouts.
	  You probably want to use the bcm socket in most cases where cyclic
	  LIN messages are used on the bus (e.g. when operating in master mode).
	  To use frame scheduling, use AF_LIN with protocol LIN_FRAME_SCHED.

config LIN_ISOTP
	tristate "ISO 15765-2 LIN transport protocol"
	help
	  LIN Transport Protocols offer support for segmented Point-to-Point
	  communication between LIN nodes via two defined LIN Identifiers.
	  This protocol driver implements segmented data transfers for LIN introduced in ISO 15765-2:2016.
	  As LIN frames can only transport a small amount of data bytes
	  (max. 8 bytes) this segmentation is needed to transport longer Protocol Data Units (PDU)
	  as needed e.g. for vehicle diagnosis or IP-over-LIN
	  traffic.
